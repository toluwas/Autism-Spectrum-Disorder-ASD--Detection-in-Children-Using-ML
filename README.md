# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection in Children Using Machine Learning

Topics: autism, asd-detection, machine-learning, data-science, healthcare-ai, child-development, predictive-modeling, ai-in-healthcare, classification, python

📘 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent autism detection model that can identify early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children using behavioral, communication, and developmental data.
The model leverages machine learning techniques to assist healthcare professionals in screening and early intervention.

🎯 Objectives

Identify behavioral and developmental patterns linked to autism.

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models for ASD prediction.

Develop a reliable and interpretable model for early screening of ASD in children.

🧠 Dataset Information

The dataset includes:

Behavioral screening data from standardized autism questionnaires.

Demographic details such as age, gender, and parental observations.

Diagnostic labels indicating ASD or non-ASD cases.

Source: Open-access Autism Screening Dataset (e.g.,Kaggle).

⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

Handling missing data and outliers.

Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, responses).

Feature scaling and normalization.

Train-test split for model validation. (2 datasets were used one for training and validation and the other one for the test set)
